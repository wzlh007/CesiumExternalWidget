Hi Willem,

Thanks for the response and sorry for delay in reply.

I've modified the code based on your suggestion. It works well, when the sky is not visible. I also want to get the position when the sky is visible. 


function getExtentView() {
    var cl2 = new Cesium.Cartesian2(0, 0);
    var leftTop = viewer.scene.camera.pickEllipsoid(cl2, ellipsoid);

    cr2 = new Cesium.Cartesian2(viewer.scene.canvas.width, viewer.scene.canvas.height);
    var rightDown = viewer.scene.camera.pickEllipsoid(cr2, ellipsoid);

    if (leftTop != null && rightDown != null) {
        leftTop = ellipsoid.cartesianToCartographic(leftTop);
        rightDown = ellipsoid.cartesianToCartographic(rightDown);
        return new Cesium.Rectangle(leftTop.longitude, rightDown.latitude, rightDown.longitude, leftTop.latitude);
    } else {//The sky is visible in 3D
        console.log("Sky is visible");
        return null;
    }
}

I've also tried the suggestion given in the post(#871), but no luck :(

Can you please help to sort it out!

Thanks in advance.
